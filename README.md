# Autonomous Vehicle Framework Using Game Theory and Reinforcement Learning

This simulation was not created by me. Full credits should go towards @elurent for creating this open-source simulation: https://github.com/eleurent/highway-env

## Contributed Work
This simulation was modified to fit my research's goal of achieving an adaptive control strategy in a four-way unsignalized intersection. To view a full overview of what was modified and added to the simulation, please view my [technical paper](paper.pdf)
